# HID-Weigand-Pinpad-Reader-Arduino
Arduino Keypad and RFID reading software for HID iClass, PivClass, and MultiClass/SE 
model readers. Modified to contain scaffolding for keypress recognition.

If the bits in this software's keypress readers cannot be decoded, log the raw
bits to the console and change them accordingly.

Tested on PIVClass Reader with while reading 8 bits from the key press.
